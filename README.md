## Description
This is an attempt at the Gilded Rose refactoring kata in Ruby. See the original version here: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/ruby

The requirements of this kata are as follows:
- I have to add a new feature - the Conjured item which degrades twice as fast.
- I am allowed to make any changes to the legacy code - except for the `Item` class.

## Set-up
Move to the `ruby` dir and run `bundle` to install gems.
Run `rspec` to see test results.
